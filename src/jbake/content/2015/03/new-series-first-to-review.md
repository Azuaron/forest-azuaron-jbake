Nothing kills a book on Amazon's Kindle marketplace like having no reviews. Though I can't find any at this particular moment (\#Googlefail), I've read several articles that say even *bad* reviews are better than *no* reviews.

Keeping that in mind, and being in a [similar boat][] myself, I plan to periodically find a book for Kindle without any reviews, read it (or, at least, as much as I can tolerate if it turns out to be *that* bad), then be the [First to Review][] it.

Since I'll be giving these books star ratings on Amazon and goodreads, I'll give them here as well using the following scale:

1 - Nearly incomprehensible

2 - Can be read, but nothing to recommend it. Typos. Weak voice. Incoherent plot. When people think of fan fiction, most of it's about 2 stars.

3 - Technically competent. Readable. Unspectacular. The "popcorn movie" type of books tend to get 3 stars.

4 - Solidly good. New and interesting plot and characters and a strong voice. For me, the average Brandon Sanderson novel.

5 - Mind blowing. I-read-it-in-one-sitting. Zero-to-no flaws.

What I hope to find are solidly-written books by authors without any marketing skills. What I fear to find are endless waves of incomprehensible trash. Let's find out!

I'm starting with [*Prince of Leaf and Stone* by M. Q. Allen][Prince of Leaf and Stone_ by M. Q. Allen].
