To understand this review, first you have to understand how I read the Sandman comics. Whenever my wife goes away for a few days, I read a volume of the Absolute Sandman. I don't quite know how I started this or why, but this is how things are. And, just over a year ago, my daughter was born. The past several days have been the first my daughter's been away from me since she was born.

This is the environment in which I've started--and finished--*Absolute Sandman, Vol 4*. For reasons that will become obvious, spoilers to follow.

The arcs in Vol 4 are *The Kindly Ones* and *The Wake*. Or, to put it another way, *The Death of Dream* and, well, *The Wake*. What a positively depressing way to spend my depressing weekend away from my family. But, quite possibly the most beautiful story ever written. This is Gaiman at his best: the opposition of two unstoppable powers, very little *combat* in favor of deep *conflict*, sacrifice, grace, and transformation. I wasn't a fan of the art style for *The Kindly Ones* (seemed too cartoony), but it didn't distract and I particularly liked *The Wake*'s art.
