*This post is part of a series called [First to Review][], where I review Amazon Kindle books that haven't been reviewed by anyone else. The idea is, any review is better than no reviews.*

Amount read: 100%

When I knew what rating I'd give it: 85%

I really liked the ending of *Prince of Leaf and Stone*. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel gets in the way.

There are many times during this book I almost put it down. 12%, 34%, 55%, 67% (gotta love the Kindle's method of progress). The voice is okay and there are relatively few typos, but it reads like D&D fan fiction, even focusing on human and totally-not-elf relationships (thin "Ever-folk" with "leaf-shaped" ears). Other than the main character, Aedric, the characters are inconsistent. Most, even (especially) the long-lived Ever-folk who we're told take years to make decisions, are rash and impulsive. Apparently the love interest, Ophia, is more rash and passionate than other Ever-folk, but in actions other Ever-folk, such as Kiadrin and the King, are at least as impulsive. We're told Ever-folk who lose their spouse usually mourn for decades or even centuries, but apparently "mourn" and "immediately fall in love again" are synonyms.

The plot seems rambling and disjointed, until you get to the end where everything ties together. This can be pulled off (Neal Stephenson being the master), but here I felt more lost than anything else. It's difficult to connect with the book, since it's difficult to see what it's *about* until you reach the end. Constantly, we're told vague plot details from later in the book ("I never saw him again." "But I could never fulfill my promise.") that only serve to kill the tension.\*

Oh, but that ending. The characterization of Aedric is quite good (in hindsight), and his arc is interesting and novel, even if it wavers with the plot at times, and the pay-off is worth it. For 12% - 80% through the book, I was certain I'd give it 2 stars, but the climax elevated the whole novel.

Stars: 2.5 peridots (round up to 3) out of 5 on the following scale:

1 - Nearly incomprehensible

2 - Can be read, but nothing to recommend it. Typos. Weak voice. Incoherent plot and characters. When people think of fan fiction, most of it's about 2 stars.

3 - Technically competent. Readable. Unspectacular. The "popcorn movie" type of books tend to get 3 stars.

4 - Solidly good. New and interesting plot and characters and a strong voice. For me, the average Brandon Sanderson novel.

5 - Mind blowing. I-read-it-in-one-sitting. Zero-to-no flaws.

\* Let's talk about foreshadowing.

I read a book in school years (and years) ago. The title and author escape my memory. But, I remember the foreshadowing. In this book, a teenager in a "gang" (think Westside Story more than Bloods and Crips) stabs another teenager during some friendly neighborhood gang warfare. The other kid dies. Now, despite fighting with knives, bats, and chains, no one on either side expected anyone to *actually die* during this fight, but there you go. Our protagonist, shaking uncontrollably, lights up a cigarette to calm his nerves, and stares into the coal at the end, wondering what it would be like inside a fire. Then he goes on the run. In the climax of the book, he runs into a burning building to save a family, and no longer has to wonder what it's like inside a fire. This is foreshadowing.

"I never saw him again." "But I could never fulfill my promise." This is not foreshadowing. Done once or twice, it can serve to tie off loose ends, but when it happens nearly every chapter it's jolting and ruins the engagement.
