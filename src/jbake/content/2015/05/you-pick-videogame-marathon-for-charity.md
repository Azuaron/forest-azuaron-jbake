I have a friend from college ([@stephonee][stephonee]) who runs a yearly charity event for [charity: water][charity_ water]\*. This event takes the form of a ridiculous videogame marathon where the givers choose the games and how long they're played by their donations. It is ridiculous in that it's 48-straight hours and the chosen games aren't, shall we say, *necessarily fun to play* (Battletoads and the infamous Desert Bus are often in the list of contenders).

This event is called [UPickVG IV][], and it starts on June 12th!

\*Charity for getting clean water to people in impoverished nations without clean water.
