I've never liked Rincewind. He's got all the likability of a sea mine, and about as much directionless destructive ability. This is the point, I suppose, and while I don't necessarily need a likable lead to like a novel (certain Malazan books come to mind), there's a detestability about Rincewind that makes me want to obsessively wash my hands.

The wizards of Unseen University occupy a similar space in my brain, with the possible exception of Ponder Stibbons and the Bursar (but only by comparison to the other wizards).

"But was it *funny?*" I hear people ask in some dark corner of my brain desperate to anticipate the questions of others and answer them preemptively. Well, *yes*, it's still Pratchett, even if it's weakened by the wizzards. But it's popcorn-movie funny, in a way I won't remember two months from now. With the possible exception of the Mad Max bit, which was oddly fitting given that *Fury Road* comes out **today**.

3 armored unicycles out of a blasted wasteland full of poisonous spiders.
