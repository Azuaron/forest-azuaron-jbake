*The Martian* by Andy Weir is the best hard science fiction I've ever read (disclaimer: I haven't read a lot of hard science fiction). Simultaneously hilarious, nail-biting, and heroic while being scientifically accurate (the final print version, at least). And, since it's science fiction in the very-near-future, there's little-to-no hand-waving; the technology in the book is technology we have and understand *today*.

Most impressively, the plot is not driven by a need to move from one set-piece disaster to another--as is the case with most Man vs Nature stories. Instead, the plot is driven by the science, the probable outcomes that naturally arise from being stranded on Mars, and the direct consequences of previous actions. In other words, at no point during the novel did I have the thought, "And now for the obligatory ***X***!" (A statement I utter with increasing frequency as I read more and more books.) Finally, though both the frame (recording logs to be found later) and through the engaging personality of our hero Matt Damon Mark Watney, Weir manages to keep the book engaging even though it is, at its core, [about taking a table full of parts and connecting this thing to this thing][].

The characters are a bit thin, and everything ultimately shakes out exactly as you think it will, but it's a Hell of ride.

4 Pathfinders out of 5; would get stranded on the Red Planet again.

1 – Nearly incomprehensible

2 – Can be read, but nothing to recommend it. Typos. Weak voice. Incoherent plot and characters. When people think of fan fiction, most of it’s about 2 stars.

3 – Technically competent. Readable. Unspectacular. The "popcorn movie" type of books tend to get 3 stars.

4 – Solidly good. New and interesting plot and characters and a strong voice. For me, the average Brandon Sanderson novel.

5 – Mind blowing. I-read-it-in-one-sitting. Zero-to-no flaws.
