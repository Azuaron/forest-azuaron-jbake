It's difficult for me to say too many good things about Steven Erikson's Malazan series, and the books have been getting even better.

It's even more difficult, however, for me to say anything specific about why this book is so great, since even mentioning that a particular character is still alive (or not) at a particular point would be a serious spoiler, and I don't believe the statute of limitations has quite run out on the Malazan series.

What I can say, however, is that if you've made it *this* far, you will not be disappointed. While it doesn't quite hit the emotional impact of *Midnight Tides*, it continues Erikson's evolution as an author, and the word-smithing's better than ever. Where it falls down a little is the plot structure, which feels a little more fragmented than it needs to, right up until the last few hundred pages which are pure brilliance.

5/5 shaved knuckles in the hole.
