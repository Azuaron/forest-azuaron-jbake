I've thought a lot about the title of this book, even before I read it. Reportedly, [the translators couldn't figure out what it meant][the translators couldn_t figure out what it meant], so the international versions use the title The Music of Silence. This is most unfortunate, because I believe the title holds the key to knowing, before you've even read the book, whether you will like it.

Can you imagine the slow regard of silent things? Beneath the Earth, in the cast-off tunnels of the Underthing, can you imagine objects, tunnels, rooms contain a bit of personality, of humanity, of wakefulness and will, under the appropriate circumstances, silently regard any trespassers? Are you ready for a beautiful meditation on the nature of nature and the brokenness of broken people? Then this book is for you.

Do you look at the title "The Slow Regard of Silent Things" and say, "What the actual what?" Then this book may not be for you.

3 out of candle; would read to my daughter again.
