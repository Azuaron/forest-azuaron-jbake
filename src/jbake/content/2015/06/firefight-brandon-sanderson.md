*Firefight* is a serviceable sequel to the amazing *Steelheart*. We get a bit more of an understanding of the Epics and their powers, particularly where their powers come from... and not much else. David is David, Prof is Prof, Val is Val, and we've got some new characters to pad out the roster, but it all feels like filler, like it should have been shortened and used as the opening to *Calamity*.

Of course, having read all Sanderson's published works, it's entirely possible I'm just spoiled. It's still *Sanderson*, so it's still exciting and well-crafted. I just expect *more* from him at this point.
