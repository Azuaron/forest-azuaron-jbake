I've been away *so long* my domain name lapsed. Seriously, who does that?

Anyway, [season 10 of Writing Excuses][] is being structured as a master class in writing, so I'm going to follow along and post my homework here.

### Homework 1 ###

Write down five different story ideas in 150 words or less. Generate these ideas from these five sources:

1.  
2.  From an interview or conversation you've had
    
    Antisocial loner creates robot army using the trapped souls of the recently deceased
3.  
4.  
5.  From research you've done (reading science news, military history, etc)
    
    Sunset Invasion (Native Americans with guns invade medieval Europe)
6.  
7.  
8.  From observation (go for a walk!)
    
    Generational ship breaks apart; each half falling onto one of a set of binary planets.
9.  
10. 
11. From a piece of media (watch a movie)
    
    Time traveling undercover historian
12. 
13. 
14. From a piece of music (with or without lyrics)
    
    LKIhjsdsioaosdi asdfaklsdk aksdk fkksakd (this one's written in code, since I am paranoid, it is very specific, and I'm currently writing it)
15. 

### Homework 2 ###

Using last week's five story ideas (or five new ones):

1.  
2.  Take two of them and combine them into one story.
    
    Time traveling, undercover historian encounters antisocial loner creating a robot army from the trapped souls of the recently deceased
3.  
4.  
5.  Take one and change the genre underneath it.
    
    lkasdklf klsdfklklsdJLDSFKJ dklsfkl sdklfalksd;fasdf (new code for this one)
6.  
7.  
8.  Take one and change the ages and genders of everybody you had in mind for it
    
    Sunset Invasion, but the Native Americans have a matriarchal society
9.  
10. 
11. Take the last one and have a character make the opposite choice.
    
    Generational ship breaks apart, but the command crew sacrifices the rest of the ship to save themselves (this is a much less interesting story)
12.
