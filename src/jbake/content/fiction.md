The events that precipitated the First War Among Men; on the continent of Tarn on a planet called Earth--not to be confused with the planet Earth with which you are familiar (for clarity, if not accuracy, your Earth is Earth One; this is Earth Two); as recorded by the Archivist; events beginning on the 5th day of the 2nd month of the 1,234 Year since the Treaty (5-2-1234 YT; 4,406 Absolute Year; apologies to American readers for the day-first date formatting). All notes are notes of the Archivist (unless otherwise specified).

--

When a terrorist attack destroys the city of Ankan, the government sends for Tyran, the world's foremost expert on magical destruction and a Shard--a magician who focuses energy through crystals. The president is focused on blaming the tree people in order to start a war to steal their land. When what Tyran finds becomes more complicated than the president hopes for, factions emerge that will tear the country apart.

Approximately 80,000 words.
