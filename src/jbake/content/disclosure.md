Due to certain FCC rulings (and common sense ethical requirements), it is important for bloggers (such as myself) to disclose what we’re paying paid to do instead of passing off advertisements as genuine customer satisfaction. So, there are many things I will promise (and this will be updated as the blog evolves, but probably not much):

1.  No one will ever be paid to write a specific post here. Ever. Not me, not anyone else. (This one will not evolve as long as I'm in charge of the blog.)
2.  There will be times I will promote affiliate links. For instance, links to Amazon products? Those are affiliate links. If you click on one of those links and buy something (anything, even if it’s not what I linked to), I make money. Thank you, I appreciate it. That money helps me keep this site running (server costs, office space, time, food… you get the idea).
3.  I will never lie here, and I will attempt to never misrepresent something. April 1st supersedes this rule. And hyperbole is not to be taken seriously.
4.  If an error is made, it will be corrected as soon as I become aware of the error.
5.  I do not keep free products that I review. If I receive free products for review, I will hold a contest to give them away after they have been reviewed. If I want my own, I will have to buy my own.
