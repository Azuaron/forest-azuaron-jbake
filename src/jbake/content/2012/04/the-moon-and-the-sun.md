This is for [Matthew Inman][], who wanted to know why the Sun and Moon appear to be roughly equal sizes.

### The simple answer (which you probably already know) ###

The Sun is really big, but it's also really far away. The Moon, while much smaller, is much closer.

### The math answer ###

The size something appears to be relative to the viewer is called its "visual angle". A visual angle can be calculated using the equation V=2arctan(S/2D) where V is the visual angle, S is the linear size of the object, and D is the distance between the observer and the object.

[![visual angle][]][visual angle 1]

The Moon averages about 384,405 km from the Earth, and has a diameter (linear size) of about 3,474 km. V=2arctan(3474/(2\*384405)) = .0090378 degrees

The Sun averages about 150 million km from the Earth, and has a diameter of about 1,392,000km. V=2arctan(1392000/(2\*150000000)) = .0092799 degrees

While close, the Sun averages slightly larger than the moon (2 millionths of a degree of visual angle), which is (one of the reasons) why the Sun is not completely obscured by the Moon during an eclipse.

### But why do they appear to be the *same* size? ###

Coincidence. Earth just happens to be just far enough away from the Sun, which just happens to be just the right size to appear to be the same size as the Moon, which just happens to be the right distance from Earth and just the right size.

Or God's laughing at us.
