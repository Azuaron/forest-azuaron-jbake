Matinée is a rather interesting word, in that in English it refers to a movie or theater showing during midday/early afternoon, while the French word it originates from (matinée) literally means, "Of the morning" (from the Latin mātūtīnus) and referred to showings in the morning.

### So what happened? ###

When you were growing up, was the midday meal called dinner, or lunch? And the evening meal dinner, or supper, or either?

Convention stated that a matinée occurred before dinner (the midday meal at the time). Rich people--the people who could, in the mid 19th century, afford to go to the theater--began to sleep in as a method of showing their wealth ("Wake up at dawn? What am I, a farmer? HA HA HA I'm hilarious.") This slowly pushed "dinner" later into the day, until the wealthy were waking up around noon, and eating "dinner" around 5 pm. This forced theaters to push their matinées into the early afternoon to accommodate their late-rising patrons. As theater became cheaper, particularly with the rise of film, theaters kept their "matinées" in the early afternoon since the term had stuck, just as "dinner" became, for many people, the evening meal.
