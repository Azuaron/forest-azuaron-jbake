The catchall term for intelligence in modern settings is IQ (that is, Intelligence Quotient). Pop culture has established pretty firmly that a "normal" person has an IQ of 100, a "smart" person has an IQ near the 130s, and a supergenius has ridiculous IQ numbers anywhere from 170 to 300.

But what is an IQ test? How does it relate to how intelligent a person is?

### The Intelligence Quotient ###

In the early 1900s, many people became interested in making better people through social and genetic engineering (the eugenics movement). They thought that by identifying school children who would grow up to be mentally retarded, they could sterilize those children and, through a forced Darwinian selection, breed more intelligent people.

During World War I, these tests were used to rapidly assign recruits to various training programs. Score high? Officer training. Score above average? Piloting, sniping, or driving. Score low? Infantry. This expanded use of the intelligence tests drove funding and efforts toward a universal theory of general intelligence and beyond the eugenics movement.

Ultimately, while evidence for a theory of general intelligence has been found (*g*), it remains disputed. Further, researchers can't agree on a single "perfect" test, so an "IQ score" may be from [any of a number of tests][]. These tests tend to measure reasoning, spatial ability, pattern recognition, and verbal comprehension.

Fortunately, the tests seem to predict the same thing, and they're all mapped onto the same "IQ score" system and are often used in conjunction with each other.

### The IQ score ###

When someone says they have an IQ of 170 (or 100, or 70, or 121), what does that mean? Unfortunately, it's pretty deep into statistics, but I'll try and gloss over the math as much as possible.

When one of the IQ tests is taken, a raw score is calculated. Depending on the test, this raw score can range from 5 to 2,000; this score isn't actually that important.

The psychologists take that score and compare it to a whole bunch of scores they have from the same group of people (for instance, American adults). Then, depending on how that raw score compares to the other raw scores, an IQ score is assigned.

More specifically, IQ scores *always* have an average of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (for those who know what that means).

Essentially, the average IQ is always 100. *Always.* The average IQ has not risen, nor has it dropped, in the past *\{number\}* years. The average IQ is 100 *by definition* and it always will be.

(Whether the raw scores have risen or dropped, or are going to rise or drop, is another issue; [they have risen in recent decades][], cause currently disputed.)

The standard deviation is a bit more complicated. What it means is that 95% of *everyone* in the group will have a score between 70 and 130. It also means that a large change in the raw scores near the average (700 to 800) can result in a small change in IQ score (100 to 103), while a small change in the raw scores away from the average (1000 to 1010) can have a dramatic change in the IQ score (150 to 170).

Further, any IQ measured above 145 (3 standard deviations) is, essentially, too smart for the test, and no more specific conclusions can be drawn about them.

So, when there's intellectual *\*ahem\** measuring going on, and one character compares their 153 IQ to another's 150 IQ, several thoughts should spring to mind:

 *  Did they both take the same kind of test?
 *  What were their raw scores (are they comparing the difference between a single question)?
 *  Have they taken multiple tests, or was one (or both) lucky on one test?
 *  Even if everything's as accurate as it can be, the difference between 150 and 153 is negligeable and functionally unmeasurable.

And anyone claiming to have an IQ over 200 is lying, or was lied to. Most tests "top out" around 160, meaning that the test taker has answered every question correctly, and can't possibly get a better score.

#### What does IQ measure? What does it predict? ####

IQ has been proposed as a general intelligence measure, which is as specific as it sounds: how smart a person is. Since the test creators were mostly male, and American or English, "smart" is measured as a Western male English-speaker would define it, and the IQ test has been frequently criticized as such. In particular, the IQ test fails to account for emotional intelligence (empathy), creativity, cultural and lingual differences, and social ability.

Regardless of its failings, IQ can predict things like college grades, occupation, and income level with a fair amount of accuracy (*r* = .7 for college grades, if you care).

#### What can I do with IQ? ####

Don't misuse it. While there are certainly societies (such as Mensa) that take great stock in such scores, they tend to, ironically, misuse them. Generally speaking, though, a certain amount of whatever IQ measures is required for success, but is not sufficient. To succeed, people need creativity, adaptability, social skills, and dozens of other traits.
