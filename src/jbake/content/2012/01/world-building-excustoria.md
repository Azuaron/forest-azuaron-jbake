If you're not familiar with [Writing Excuses][], become familiar. If you are, go listen to the [episode concerning Fauna and Flora][]. You'll probably want to familiarize yourself with the [magic system][] as well, if you haven't already.

Then join us at the [Excustoria wiki][] for building the coastal ecology.
