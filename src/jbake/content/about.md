*Recent revision: I don't know what Forest Azuaron is anymore. We'll see, I guess?*

Forest Azuaron is a science resource for writers (and anyone else). I'll explore how science is misused in books, movies, and videogames; who writes science well; and how you can write science well. Many of the posts are geared toward fantasy (giant spiders?) and science fiction (sound in space?), but most are broadly applicable to any genre.

### Who are you? ###

![me-suit-outside][]I am Sam Brougher. In 2008 I got my Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a minor in Creative Writing and a concentration in Information Technology. Two years later I graduated with my Master of Science in Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychology with focuses on Human-Computer Interaction, Information Processing, and Interactive Programming. In addition, I've taken courses in biology, physics, advanced mathematics, chemistry, and engineering.

Primarily, though, I just really love science.

Professionally, I'm a programmer. My first novel, [Letters to an Old God][], was self-published on Amazon (so you know it's a big deal).

I'm married, have a 1-year-old daughter, and am staff to a pair of cats.
