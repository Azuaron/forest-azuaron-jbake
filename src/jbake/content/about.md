<img style="float:left;" src="images/DressedUp.jpg" alt="Sam Brougher" />I am Sam Brougher. In 2008 I got my Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a minor in Creative Writing and a concentration in Information Technology. Two years later I graduated with my Master of Science in Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychology with focuses on Human-Computer Interaction, Information Processing, and Interactive Programming. In addition, I’ve taken courses in biology, physics, advanced mathematics, chemistry, and engineering.

Professionally, I’m a Software Engineer at Curriculum Associates. My first novel, Letters to an Old God, was self-published on Amazon (so you know it’s a big deal). At various times I [start and stop open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/Azuaron);

I’m married, have a 2-year-old daughter and a &lt;1 year old daughter, and am staff to a pair of cats.
