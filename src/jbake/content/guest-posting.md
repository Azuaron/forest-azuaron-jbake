![write][]The aim of this blog is to promote science and science awareness among writers. Guest posting is a great way for you to help the writing community become aware of scientific progress (and get exposure for your own writing). And I'm happy to get new content. Nevertheless, it will need to fit the following guidelines:

 *  
 *  This is a science blog for writers, and as such, posts should relate to both science and writing (heavy on the science).
 *  
 *  
 *  The article should be useful for the readers, and not market your book/product. That doesn't mean you can't write an article on a topic related to your product.
 *  
 *  
 *  Try to tailor your article to this blog's style (reading some of the posts on the blog should give you feel of the blog).
 *  
 *  
 *  This is a PG website--no cursing, but medical terminology is acceptable if required for the article. If medical terminology is used, it must be used without juvenile giggling.
 *  
 *  
 *  Articles must be unique (not published anywhere else, even your own blog). You can repost the article after it's been published here.
 *  
 *  
 *  Please include a brief paragraph (a couple sentences) with information about yourself, your science/writer qualifications, and a link to where people can find you online.
 *  
 *  
 *  Any images in the article must be either yours, licensed openly (such as Creative Commons), or ones for which you have purchased the rights. If you don't include images, I'll probably find some.
 *  
 *  
 *  Major articles should be around 1,000 words, and never longer than 1,500 words. Article series should be split into 1,000 word chunks. Bear in mind, article series are far more likely to be rejected than stand-alone articles.
 *  
 *  
 *  Minor articles are for "breaking news" topics and are typically a short introduction, and a link to a full article. If you bring my attention to the article, I'll link to you (e.g., "Thank you John Smith for bringing this to our attention!").
 *  
 *  
 *  I am the complete dictator of this blog, and I will (likely!) edit your article, headline, and/or images, or reject it if it's not appropriate or I'm already planning a similar article.
 *  
 *  
 *  There may be a significant delay in posting the article. Once I have accepted your article, I will give you an estimated publishing date, but that may change. I will keep you updated to any changes in your article's publishing date.
 *  

### Okay, okay, how do I send you my post? ###

Use the form below to tell me a bit about yourself and the article you'd like to write. If you have already written the article, append it to the end of your statement. Articles are left on the front page for about a week, and promoted on Twitter.

Thank you very much!
